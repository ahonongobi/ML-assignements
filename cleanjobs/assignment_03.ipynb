    "Welcome to the third lab. There is much to go through today so we will keep extra concepts to a minimum. There is no new library introduced at this lecture as we will keep using `numpy` for the heavy lifting, `scikit-learn` for the algorithms, and `seaborn` / `matplotlib` for plotting. Careful about reusing variable names in the notebook and computing cells out of order: frequent calls to `Kernel -> Restart and Run All` can save you from headaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment starts getting math-heavy. Here's a new tool to aid you with the debugging. Explicitly `import IPython` at the beginning of a notebook (or Python file) to have access to the computational Python kernel. You can then call `IPython.embed()` at an arbitrary place in your code (say, inside a loop) and it will pause the computation and drop you into an interactive console. You can then evaluate Python code in the context where it was called. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    guess = np.random.normal()\n",
    "    function_that_fails_because_of(guess, i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say your function fails for `i==9`, how would you find the error? Typically you may want to edit the code and print `guess` and `i` to see what is happening, but it is slow and passive. What if you want to try to pass `i+1` and see if that works? What if you want to try a few other random numbers with the same `i`? Enter `IPython.embed()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import IPython\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    guess = np.random.normal()\n",
    "    if i==9: IPython.embed()\n",
    "    function_that_fails_because_of(guess, i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you execute this code, the cell output will show an interactive console in your output cell. Here you can send commands to be interpreted by the Python kernel of the notebook. You could then try something like the following lines for example (one at a time):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i #=> prints value of i\n",
    "guess  #=> prints value of guess\n",
    "function_that_fails_because_of(guess, i) #=> fails and shows you the error\n",
    "function_that_fails_because_of(guess, i+1) #=> change parameters: will it work?\n",
    "function_that_fails_because_of(guess, i-1) #=> what about this one?\n",
    "guess = np.random.normal() #=> overwrites the value of `guess` in the kernel\n",
    "function_that_fails_because_of(guess, i) #=> will this work this time?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see you can test your code in the context of the function (or, here, loop), find the code that works, then you can go ahead and copy+paste in your actual code. If you need to exit the console and resume the computation (with whatever change you executed, as the kernel is the same) just type `exit()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Bonus:_ you can ask the kernel to drop you into a _debugger_ session every time you get an error. This can be tricky with Jupyter Notebooks, so use with caution, but can also be a lifesaver if you are willing to learn about [postmortem debugging](https://medium.com/instamojo-matters/become-a-pdb-power-user-e3fc4e2774b2). You do that by adding the following lines on top of your code (need to execute them only once):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# DEBUG: uncaught exceptions drop you into ipdb for postmortem debugging\n",
    "import sys, IPython; sys.excepthook = IPython.core.ultratb.ColorTB(call_pdb=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After this line, if you encounter an error or uncaught exception in your code, rather than terminating you will be dropped in an `ipdb` (fancier version of `pdb`) console where you can interrogate the program about the conditions causing the crash.\n",

    "Stop for a moment and think how hard it was to derive these equations (in the lecture), and how hard it was instead to implement them (once you get them right). These are two very different skills.  \n",
    "To understand the derivation you need to think hard, express your concept in math (actually requiring broad knowledge of many of its subfields), see it through with absolute precision, and finally correctly solve the equations.  \n",
    "To implement the method, you need to map the math to the correct function calls (hard, but arguably less), and you only ever work with the final solution, but you deal with programming languages and libraries and documentations.  \n",
    "This is the reason why so many people nowadays broadly advertise machine learning skills after taking short tutorials. But if you do not understand what a parameter is for, you will only be guessing which value to use.\n",

    "The reason why you are sweating so much on this course is to gain an edge over all of those who only ever learn to _use_ the tools: by instead _making_ the tools you understand them from the inside out, their applications and limitations, and even become capable of adapting and improving them.  \n",
    "Keep up: this course is not easy, but machine learning has become unavoidable in your field, and these foundations will enable you to bend the whole field to your needs."
