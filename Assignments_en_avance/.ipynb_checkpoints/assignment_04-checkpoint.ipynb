    "Welcome to the fourth lab. This week the math load is lower on purpose to give you a chance to catch up on the first 3 labs before we start to _use_ all the foundations you learned so far. You may want to go back and fix your submissions with the help of the solutions, you will need the material for the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we introduce the major data analysis library in Python: [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/). You can think of it as providing **feature-rich data containers**: load your data in a `pandas` object and you will have fast access, manipulation, statistics, even math with `numpy` and plotting with `matplotlib`, all well integrated.  \n",
    "Unfortunately it also has a fame of being frustrating, unintuitive and stubborn for the newcomers, so I suggest you spend some time practicing and download the documentation as [offline pdf](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/pandas.pdf) for the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main classes are `Series`, for one-dimensional data, and `DataFrame` for _tensors_. You may have heard this word before: you can think of a tensor as a generic structure for feature-based data. A zero-dimensional tensor is a scalar; a 1D tensor is a vector; a 2D tensor is a matrix; you can imagine a 3D tensor as a cube, or as a list of matrices. Higher dimensions are of course hypercubes.  \n",
    "You will start mostly using `DataFrame`s with 2D tables/matrices, but some methods will return (kind-of) higher-dimensional tensors (e.g. be careful with [`groupby()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html)! Takes time to grasp).\n",
    "\n",
    "This library is best learned hands-on, but before starting it is important to understand how the data is stored and accessed."

    "## The feature's perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look again at our dataset of snakes. It has three fields: `head size`, `length` (in cm) and whether it is `poisonous` or not. It looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "snakes = [['small', 38, False],\n",
    "          ['small', 62, True],\n",
    "          ['medium', 55, True]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This form puts the emphasis on the data points (the rows), which is an intuitive approach at first for humans to manually write down the data. We can scroll to the middle of a dataset in a CSV or text file and read one line -- in principle, if the columns are few and we remember their order.  \n",
    "Accessing the data by indices can also be confusing: if you want to know whether the second snake is poisonous you should use `snakes[1][2]`, which is prone to the type of misunderstandings that lead to bugs (e.g. writing instead `[2][1]`).  \n",
    "From the machine perspective this is not an issue, but this way of storing has the distinct (performance) disadvantage of having **multiple types** in the same data structure: here we have lists with strings, floats and booleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative form to represent the data which is also very common (you already encountered it e.g. for data plotting) gives instead priority to the columns or *features*. It contains the same data, but rows and columns are *transposed*:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "snakes = [['small', 'small', 'medium'],\n",
    "          [38, 62, 55],\n",
    "          [False, True, True]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see each feature is not in its own list, and all types are the same, meaning we could store it in a specialized array casted to the correct data type, and enjoy a big performance boost.  \n",
    "Moreover, we can now switch to a hash map (a `dict` in Python), allowing us to include the feature name and use them for indexing, making the data and its description self-contained:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "snakes = {'head_size' : np.array(['small', 'small', 'medium'], dtype='str'),\n",
    "          'length'    : np.array([38, 62, 55], dtype='float'),\n",
    "          'poisonous' : np.array([False, True, True], dtype='bool')}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This has the added advantage that you can now call the vast library of `numpy` methods on your features, such as: `snakes['length'].mean()`. Create a new cell below, copy+paste the code and give it a try!\n",
    "\n",
    "Data access readability is also improved by using explicit feature names: `snakes['poisonous'][1]` does not leave room for misunderstandings, it is the `poisonous` field of the first data point. Writing `snakes[1]['poisonous']` will now raise an error (remember: errors are your friends when debugging, what is dangerous is a silent bug).  \n",
    "One last feature we could add is to add an explicit extra feature called `index` with incremental numbers for the data points, which allows us to explicitly sort the data or access by index as we did before:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "snakes = {'index'     : np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype='int'),\n",
    "          'head_size' : np.array(['small', 'small', 'medium'], dtype='str'),\n",
    "          'length'    : np.array([38, 62, 55], dtype='float'),\n",
    "          'poisonous' : np.array([False, True, True], dtype='bool')}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Isn't that neat? Congratulations, you just derived a naïve implementation of a Pandas `DataFrame`. Get used to this name because you will be using it all the time over the next weeks."

    "## Pandas objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's actually convert our data to a `DataFrame` so we can play with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(snakes) # the constructor accept most sensible inputs\n",
    "df.head() # this prints the first few lines of your (potentially large) dataframe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A few tips before we start:\n",
    "- DataFrames are composed of `Series` to hold the features: Series wrap the Numpy array to extend with more methods, so anything you can do with a Numpy array can be done with most Pandas structures, and much more.\n",
    "- Data always has an `index` (actually of class `Index`, a special Series), and if you took a database course you should know why (hint: primary key). You can provide an index explicitly, or it will automatically generate one on creation from a counter.\n",
    "- Accessing data with `[]` (e.g. `df['length']`) does not give direct pointer access at the stored data, but returns a [copy-on-write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) handler. This means that creation is free, read access is fast, but trying to write or edit the data first generates a _copy_ of the data, and then edits that. The original is unchanged by `[]`. The full truth is actually even more complex, e.g. try creating a new column `df['new_col'] = 5`, this requires no copy)\n",
    "- To access the data directly by column name and index, you should use `df.loc[]` (by index and column) and `df.iloc[]` (by indices). Yes they are both methods but they take square parenthesis (ah, python...). Data access is even more confusing than this, and you will need some serious practice to reliably get Pandas to do what you want. Do not skip on this! I suggest you follow [this tutorial](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-6fcd0170be9c).\n",
    "- Sometimes you need to access ranges of values. Ranges in Python are also [weird](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html): keep in mind that you can use the explicit `range()` method, or more commonly the `:` format: `start:end:step`. Funny part, all three are optional: `:k` means from the first to the $k^{th}$ element (excluded: the `end` is never included in a Python range, careful); `p:` means from element number `p` until the end; `::2` means (from beginning to end but only) every second element; and most importantly `:` means all elements. This is necessary as `iloc` always requires rows as first argument, so if you want the third column (implicitly: *values of all rows* for the third column) you need to write `df.iloc[:,2]` (remember indices start from 0). Again, complex to grasp, but super easy and obvious once you get it: practice it!\n",
    "- You can access the data by \"conditions\", by generating a boolean array that will hard-select the rows or columns you want. Yeah even more confusing :) bear with me. Try writing `df['length']<60`: this will return a *boolean numpy array*, with values `[True, False, True]`. This is the answer to the boolean question you asked. Now to get the lines of the dataframe that answered True, you need to write `df[df['length']<60]`. Read it and try it until it makes sense before moving forward. Also do yourself a favor and check also the second part of the tutorial above ([boolean indexing](https://www.dunderdata.com/blog/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-part-2)): all the time you invest now in Pandas will pay dividends later in the harder assignments.\n",
    "- You can plot the dataframe data directly using the function `df.plot()` (takes `type=` as a parameter), which is sometimes useful for a quick peek. In almost every practical case though it is easier (and produces better results) to simply use `seaborn`, because it integrates DataFrames natively! Finally a good news! try `sns.barplot(data=df, y='length', x=df.index, hue='poisonous')`\n",
    "- Most DataFrame methods also return the result of a computation as a \"copy\" or \"view\" on the Pandas object. If you want your method calls to have persistent consequences, which means you want to modify the original data, you should either (i) capture the output in a variable and use that, or (ii) use the optional argument `inplace=True` which is available for most methods and forces modifying the original data."
